## 🔍 Debug Information:

### Console Logs Added:
1. **Data Level Logs:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Arabic levels in data:', unique)
   console.log('English levels in data:', unique)
   ```

2. **Filter Matching Logs:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(`CV ${cv.id}: Arabic level = ${cv.arabicLevel}, Filter = ${arabicLevelFilter}`)
   console.log(`CV ${cv.id}: English level = ${cv.englishLevel}, Filter = ${englishLevelFilter}`)
   ```

3. **Filter Change Logs:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Filters changed:', {
     arabicLevelFilter,
     englishLevelFilter,
     experienceFilter,
     educationFilter
   })
   ```

4. **Results Count Logs:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(`Filtered CVs: ${result.length} out of ${allFilteredCvs.length} total`)
   ```

## 🎯 Filter Mapping:

### Arabic/English Level Filter Options:
- **لا** → Matches `NO` in database
- **ضعيف** → Matches `NO` in database  
- **جيد** → Matches `YES` or `WILLING` in database
- **ممتاز** → Matches `YES` in database

### Database Values:
- `YES` = Person knows the language
- `NO` = Person doesn't know the language
- `WILLING` = Person is willing to learn

---

## 🚀 How to Test:

1. **Open Sales 1 page**
2. **Open browser console (F12)**
3. **Try different language filters:**
   - Select "لا" in Arabic filter
   - Select "جيد" in English filter
   - Select "ممتاز" in Arabic filter
4. **Check console logs** to see:
   - What language levels exist in the data
   - How filters are being applied
   - How many CVs match each filter

---

## 📊 Expected Results:

### Console Output Example:
```
Arabic levels in data: ['YES', 'NO', 'WILLING']
English levels in data: ['YES', 'NO', 'WILLING']
Filters changed: {arabicLevelFilter: 'جيد', englishLevelFilter: 'ALL', ...}
CV 1: Arabic level = YES, Filter = جيد
CV 2: Arabic level = NO, Filter = جيد
Filtered CVs: 5 out of 10 total
```

### Filter Behavior:
- **"لا"** should show CVs with `NO` language level
- **"جيد"** should show CVs with `YES` or `WILLING` language level
- **"ممتاز"** should show CVs with `YES` language level
- **"ضعيف"** should show CVs with `NO` language level

## 🔧 Files Modified:

1. **`src/app/sales1/page.tsx`**
   - Enhanced language filter logic
   - Added debug logging
   - Fixed type safety issues
   - Added data level extraction for debugging

---

## 🎉 Result:

The language filters should now work correctly with proper debugging information to help identify any remaining issues. The console logs will show exactly what's happening with the filtering process.

**Test the filters and check the console for debugging information!** 🚀
